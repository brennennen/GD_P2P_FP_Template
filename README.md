# GD_P2P_FP_Template
A peer-to-peer first-person template for creating games in godot.

## Setup
* Requires manually install addons to save on repo size.
  * addons:
	* godotsteam
	* steam-multiplayer-peer
	* imgui-godot
* Some larger art assets that are "work in progress" have also not been committed to prevent too much lfs churn and repo size issues.


## TODO
* client respawning doesn't work
* if client shoots projectile, it doesn't delete when it collides (but it does do pull logic...)
*
